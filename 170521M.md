## Learned concepts

* **Smart Contract**

In this assignment, smart contracts include the business logic that is used to manage the assets on the blockchain ledger.  They are stored on the blockchain and run when a set of predetermined conditions are met. They can be used to automate the workflows.

A consensus algorithm is a technique that allows all peers in the Blockchain network to agree on the current state of the distributed ledger. In this assignment, we learned how the consensus algorithm is used to come to an agreement on the order of transactions across the network.
